# Aviation-DBMS
Database in Azure server with fictional data from an airline company. Project of Design of Industrial Information Systmes course with the goal to create a database with Microsoft's Azure Database.

1st Report: For the 1st report I created different relations in the database with its corresponding Primary keys and Foreign keys. Schema examples would be:  
Airplanes(TailNum integer Primary Key, manufacturer string, model integer)  
Employee(EmployeeID integer Primary Key, FName string, LName string...)  
* An ERD was also created using Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio

2nd Report: For the 2nd Report different queries were executed to manipulate and find valuable insights from the data. Examples would me most transitted cities, frequent fliers...
In this report, the database used was the one created by the professor (which is the one shared below). This databas was used because it has all the data created for each relation.

3rd Report: Here, different triggers were created with the goal to mantain order and secure the relations.
